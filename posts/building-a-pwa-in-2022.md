An h1 header
============
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:
* this one
* that one
* the other one
Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,
